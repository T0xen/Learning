This is for Java-specific projects meant for learning. I will include brief overviews of the projects I do below this.

# Calculator

This is a simple calculator using Java since I wanted to gain experience writing code in the language.

## Iteration 1 - Core Functionality

- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, & Division
- Input validation
- Multiple operations before the program ends
- Calculation Output

## Iteration 2 - Expanding on Usefullness/Useability

- Change from floats to doubles
- More than 2 variables per operation
- Code refactoring and cleanup
- Allow an entire operation to be written in one line and parsed

## Iteration 3 & Beyond (Planned) - Adding More Technically Intensive Features

- Add a GUI w/ AWT
- Add more operations like a normal calculator
- Create a branch from the CLI version that allows for math calculations based on games
